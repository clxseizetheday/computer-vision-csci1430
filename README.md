This is a repo for my Computer Vision (CSCI 1430) projects at Brown. Support code, including helper functions and CSS, was written by Prof. James Hays and the TA staff. Information on the class can be found at http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1430/. All other code was written by Michael J. Lee in MATLAB. There are a lot of untracked dependencies that I canâ€™t resolve because I do not have a MATLAB license anymore. I have also omitted the (egregiously large) training data sets. However, an explanation of my algorithm and results can be found in the html/index.html file.
